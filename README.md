### Contributing

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed.
2. Fork the repo.
3. Clone the repo.
4. Open the cloned repo on your computer.
5. Install root dependencies with `npm install`.
6. Run `npx lerna bootstrap` **in the project root** to install the monorepo's dependencies.
7. Download the environment files and secrets from here: https://gofile.io/d/ulVoX5
8. Once downloaded, place them in the cloned repo following the zip's folder structure. Now replace the APOLLO_KEY environment variable of the **services** and **NOT** the api gateway for your own user key which you can get in [AGM](https://engine.apollographql.com)
9. Now you can start up the application (dev environment) by running the following:
   1. `npm run containers:dev` **(wait for this to finish)**, _whenever both the database and the redis instance display they're ready to accept connections this should be finished._
   2. `npm run dev`.
