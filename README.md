### Collaborating
1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed.
2. Fork the repo.
3. Clone the repo.
4. Open the cloned repo on your computer.
5. Install lerna with `npm install -g lerna` **or** you can use `npx` to run the commands as an alternative.
6. Run `lerna bootstrap` **in the project root** to install the monorepo's dependencies and `npm install` also in the project root to install eslint and others.
7. Download the environment files and secrets from here: https://gofile.io/d/nwU122
8. Once downloaded, place them in the cloned repo following the zip's folder structure. Now replace the APOLLO_KEY environment variable of the **services** and **NOT** the api gateway for your own user key which you can get in [AGM](https://engine.apollographql.com)
9. Now you can start up the application (dev environment) with `docker-compose up`
